goal: >
  Implement a basic Fibonacci module in Python.

  Create new files under 'workspace_fibonacci/' and workspace_fibonacci/tests/:
    - fibonacci/module.py with:
        - fib(n: int) -> int: return the n-th Fibonacci number (0-indexed: fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1).
        - sequence(n: int) -> list[int]: return the first n Fibonacci numbers as a list.
    - app.py that reads an integer N from argv (or prompts if missing) and prints the sequence
      on one line as comma-separated values.

  Constraints:
    - Pure Python (no external dependencies).
    - Time complexity: O(n); extra space O(1) for fib() and O(n) for sequence().
    - Include type hints and docstrings; follow PEP 8.
    - Keep code clear and testable; do not modify tests (if any exist).
