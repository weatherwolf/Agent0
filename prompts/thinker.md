# Thinker Agent

This is a placeholder prompt file for the Thinker Agent. The Thinker Agent uses custom system prompts for gap detection and JSON synthesis instead of this file.

The actual prompts are located in:
- `prompts/thinker/system_gap_detection.md`
- `prompts/thinker/system_json_synthesis.md`
- `prompts/thinker/few_shot_examples.md`

This file exists only to satisfy the BaseAgent inheritance requirements.
